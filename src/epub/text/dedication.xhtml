 UKRIDGE 
 WHAT THIS STORY IS ABOUT 
<p> “Do not count your chickens before they<br/>
 are hatched” is a classic saying that might<br/>
 well have been remembered by Ukridge.<br/>
 Ukridge is always on the verge of making a<br/>
 fortune and counting his thousands before<br/>
 they are made. But Dame Fortune is a<br/>
 fickle jade. She eludes him in his great<br/>
 scheme about the dog college, wherein he was<br/>
 to turn out a world supply of trained dogs,<br/>
 and likewise in his backing of Battling Billson,<br/>
 the tender-hearted pugilist. But hope<br/>
 and George Tupper keep Ukridge going.<br/>
 He is ever ready for the next assault.</p>
